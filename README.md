# churn analysis
The churn analysis project aims to predict whether or not customers will leave a given company through the characteristics and behavior associated with them. The prediction of Churn is of vital importance for an institution, since, based on the characteristics of these customers, it is possible to propose improvements in order to increase satisfaction of them and avoid this abandonment. Furthermore, there is a significant impact on the company's financial health, as a massive loss of customers can lead to large losses in revenue. Therefore, it is of great value to carry out this study to ensure the proper functioning of a given institution.
